Included in this submission, there are 3 .R files that solve parts 2, 3, and 4
of this project. They are called p2_final.R, p3_final.R, p4_final.R. In order for any 
of these to work, you first must run the plink commands specified in the text file 
'plink_commands.txt'. These will generate the following files that are necessary for
these scripts to run: (The first three will be generated by the commands outlined in
'plink_commands.txt', and the last file must be downloaded and unziped from UKBiobank
website database). Note that p2_final.R attempts to install the library which contain
the function 'fread()', which is also used in p4_final.R, so if this library is not
installed prior to running these scripts, you will need to run p2_final.R to run 
p4_final.R without error

Necessary files:

plink.assoc.linear
snpdata_12.tfam
snpdata_12.tped
30760_irnt.gwas.imputed_v3.both_sexes.tsv

in a linux command shell, you run the following commands to run the R scripts to solve
parts 2, 3, and 4 of this project. Alternatly, rou can open and run each of these scripts
in 64-bit RGui to solve the problems as well (still in the same order as listed below)

> Rscript p2_final.R
... This solves part 2, running linear regressings to determine p-vals for the SNPs in the dataset
... This also prints out a value periodically, which is equal to the number of p-values this
... script has determined via linear regression up to that point (you can think of this
... as a progress bar; once the value reaches 828,325 the script will have computed p-values
... for every SNP in the dataset). This will output a plot of the different in p-value calculated
... by plink and R linear regression

> Rscript qqman.r
> Rscript p3_final.R
... This solves part 3, generating the Manhatten plot of the GWAS. Note that you need to run 
... qqman.r before p3_final.R, since the latter script requires the 'manhatten()' function
... implemented in qqman.r

> Rscript p4_final.R
... This solves part 4, finding the SNP in each chromosome with minimum p-value, and comparing
... these p-values to those found in the UKBB database. This will print out a table summarizing
... the data at the end of the script
